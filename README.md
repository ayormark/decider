Decide what to do and when to do it

This tool combines the Likert scale, Eisenhower Matrix, Project Management principles, and the QuickSort algorithm together to streamline decision making. This was a project for personal use, and so it is run directly from R. Once run, the script automatically reorders tasks within the "My Tasks" section of Asana.
